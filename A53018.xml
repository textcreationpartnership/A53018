            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>nce of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and jealous of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Victories. The Power and Policy of that Monarch forbidding their further encreaſe, put him upon the deſign of leſſening 'em by hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and indirect ways. His Honour wou'd not permit him to appear bare-fac'd in favour of the Infidels; the Diviſion he meditated was equally againſt his Reputation and Character of <hi>Most Chriſtian:</hi> But the Hereditary Hatred of the Houſe of <hi>France</hi> to that of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> carry'd it over the general Good of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and over a Twenty years Truce newly concluded, which promiſed to <hi>Germany</hi> a full Repoſe.</p>
            <p>In view of an enſuing War, and with deſign to proſecute it, the Agents of <hi>France</hi> at the Court of <hi>Maximilian-Henry</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> diſpoſed that Prince to demand, before his Death, a Succeſſor of his Chapter: The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons-Suffragans, who compoſed it, being for the moſt part gained by the Mony and fair Promiſes of <hi>France,</hi> gave him Cardinal <hi>Fuſtemberg</hi> for Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor: The Forces of that Crown had at the ſame time in their Poſſeſſion one of the beſt Places of the Electorate, and after having furniſhed it with all ſorts of Ammunition, laid ſtill till Heaven ſhoul'd diſpoſe of the Elector.</p>
            <p>After the death of this Prince, which happen'd the 3d of <hi>June</hi> 1688. the King of <hi>France</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to have Cardinal <hi>Fuſtemberg</hi> Recognized for his Lawful Succeſſor; but as the Poſtulation to the Coadjutorſhip was not accepted at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Threatnings of the Pope and of the Emperor, obliged the Canons to proceed, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, to the Election of a new Prince; where the Count of <hi>Conis,</hi> in the Emperor's Name, propoſed Prince <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of Cardinal <hi>Fuſtemberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Canons, to the number of 25, meeting in their Aſſembly the 19th of <hi>July</hi> 1688. divided in their Choice; 14 poſtulated the Cardinal, 9 the Prince of <hi>Bavaria</hi> by virtue of his Brief of Eligibility, by which the Pope ſupply'd the defect of his Age, he being then but 17 years old: In all appearance the Cardinal ought to have carry'd it; but the Conteſt being ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope decided in favour of the Prince of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> tho', to take the thing right, the Poſtulation of the Cardinal was Legal and Canonical.</p>
            <p>This partial Stroke provoked the King of <hi>France</hi> beyond meaſure, and unſeaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding his Politicks obliged him to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf openly, and ſupport with Honour his firſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37173:2"/>Deſign and his firſt Intentions. To this end he levied a powerful Army, which he ſent under the Command of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> his Son into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> This Prince meeting no oppoſition took <hi>Philipsbourg, Mayence, Manheim, Spire</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendal;</hi> put all the <hi>Palatinate</hi> to Fire and Sword, and deſtroyed that fine Country in ſo dreadful and terrible a manner, that one may ſeek at this time for the four laſt mentioned Towns, in the very Place wherein they ſtood 5 years ago.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons which that Monarch made uſe of to juſtify ſuch barbarous Hoſtilities, were not grounded upon the Quarrel about the Electorate of <hi>Cologn,</hi> but on the late Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>'s refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to give the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleance</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the Eſtate fallen to her by the death of her Father.</p>
            <p>This Elector ſeeing himſelf innocently the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Sacrifice of a powerful Monarch, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to revenge the ill Uſages he met with all from the Crown of <hi>France:</hi> They unanimouſly eſpouſed the Quarrel at <hi>Ausbourg;</hi> and the State of my Affairs required I ſhould enter into the League with them, the better to reſiſt the firſt Efforts which I foreſaw would be Levelled againſt me.</p>
            <p>I was then in <hi>England,</hi> whither the Troubles raiſed againſt King <hi>James,</hi> by his Subjects, called me to be a Mediator and Arbiter betwixt them; and perhaps wou'd have accompliſh'd it, had that Prince and his Subjects, reciprocally had, more Deference for each other.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> quietly ſucceeded King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, his Brother, in his Dominions, and the beginning of his Reign ſeemed to promiſe him a continued Tranquility. The Death of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the moſt part of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices ſtruck Terror into the moſt Deſperate; and were it not for the Deſign he formed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite to his own Religion, that of the Subjects one may ſay, he might have been ſtill upon the Throne, and that no Revolution could have interrupted the Felicity of his Reign; but am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to render himſelf abſolute in a Monarchy depending of the Humours of thoſe, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and to fix a Conſtancy in a People na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Inconſtant; and to immitate the Actions of a powerful King, without having the Means and Forces, like him, to effect it; drew upon him that dreadful Crowd of Misfortunes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, perhaps, his Head, after the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Fatality, would have fallen, had not I taken Care, under Hand, to ſave it from his Subjects. The King of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Steps he intended to follow, was then endeavouring the extinction of <hi>Calviniſm</hi> in his Dominions: The numerous Troops he employ'd in that Work forced the moſt obſtinate to a ſpeedy compliance: His Policy reſerved this great Action, that by the happy Succeſs of it, his Glory might be compleated. It was certainly a Deſign becoming the Greatneſs of that Monarch, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Peace which he promiſed to himſelf after that Stroke, would never have been diſturb'd, had he but by a refined Foreſight, had the Art either to have kept within his Kingdom the Leading Men among the Proteſtants by force of Reward, or had cauſed them to be ſacrificed without Mercy on the Frontiers, inſtead of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to go out on't.</p>
            <p>But thoſe unfortunate Fugitives carrying Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, Deſolation, and Terror every where they went, looked upon <hi>England</hi> the only Place of Comfort and Eaſe to their Misfortunes; thither they retired in hopes to find Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Reſt, ſtill bewailing the Cruelty with which they were forced to abandon, as one may ſay, their Houſhold-Gods, and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> at the ſame time takes upon him to re-eſtabliſh the publick Exerciſe of the Catholick Religion all over <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had before their Eyes the ſad Example of the <hi>French</hi> Refugees, contented themſelves at firſt to murmur at the Deſign: The Novelty of it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrange to them, and were fond of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience they had enjoyed for above Two Centuries. But when they ſaw the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deſign preſſed upon 'em through the Miniſtry of the Jeſuits; when they ſaw their Town's Priviledges taken away, the Biſhops Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Fryars re-eſtabliſhed in their ancient Convents, and thoſe very Jeſuits (the unlucky Authors of all Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs) in Poſſeſſion of a College in the midſt of the City of <hi>London;</hi> then they generally, and in common Concert with the Nobility, revolted. Theſe to maintain themſelves in the Church-Lands whereof the Kings <hi>Henry</hi> 8. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> put their Anceſtors in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: The others to ſecure their Priviledges: Both together ſtirred by the implacable Motive of Religion, that ſeldom fails to cauſe a Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is of extream Conſequence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>The Revolters in the mean time ſeek for a powerful Protector and a diſintereſted Mediator, and unluckily caſt their Eyes upon me: They ſollicite my paſſing into <hi>England,</hi> and haſten to the Succour of their Religion. I was then in <hi>Holland</hi> at the Head of a numerous Army which I had raiſed, not for that end, as I am unjuſtly reproached with, but to ſupport in <hi>Germany</hi> the Intereſt of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. againſt Cardinal <hi>Fuſtemberg,</hi> or rather, more properly ſpeaking, againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the World knows how the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſollicited me at that time; the Alliances ſhe had with me by the Intrigues of <hi>Caſonis,</hi> the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of Mony I had from thence for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Deſign. All the World knows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the very ſame Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had choſe me, above all the other Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37173:2"/>the Fortune and Greatneſs of the King of <hi>France:</hi> I was promiſed an honourable Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhou'd crown me with Glory; and the Power of the Enemy I was to oppoſe took up, at that time, all my Thoughts and Care.</p>
            <p>However the Neceſſities of <hi>England</hi> at that Juncture, ſeemed to me more preſſing than thoſe of <hi>Cologn;</hi> and the Intereſt of a Religion ſo near and common to my own, prevailed with me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Intereſt of a Stranger under Oppreſſion: The Glory of reconciling a King and his Subjects, and of reciprocally ſuccouring both, weighed in my Mind over that of ſupporting in <hi>Germany</hi> the Pretenſions of a young Prince, whoſe Right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, did not appear to me to be inconteſtable.</p>
            <p>Upon this I paſſed into <hi>England,</hi> Landed my Troops without any oppoſition, the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me with open Arms: King <hi>James</hi>'s Army inſenſibly deſerted to me, ranging themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Banners; ſo that in a little time I found my ſelf in the midſt of the City of <hi>London,</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſter of all Things, without ſo much as coſting the Life of one ſingle Man, or that any of King <hi>James</hi>'s Subjects had Loyalty or Courage enough to Fight one Stroke in his Favour.</p>
            <p>Thus, in the midſt of a People ſwelled with Rage and Hatred againſt their King, I ſent the Prince private Notice that they openly threatned him, and that it was high time he ſhould ſave himſelf. I conſented to his Eſcape out of exceſs of Regard and Tenderneſs, and not in view of any private Intereſt of my own. I facilitated all Things for his Embarquement, and if he was taken the firſt time, the very moment he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it, it was ſolely an effect of the ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that attended him, and not of any Artifice or Subtilty I am reproached with: The ſecond time he had better Luck, and unthankful for the Service I had render'd him, he ſtir'd up the Moſt Chriſtian King, and made him declare againſt me, as if I had been guilty of a Misfortune which he ought to have imputed to nothing but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence of his own Conduct.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh, on their part, no ſooner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their King's retreat, than they pretended his Flight to be a tacit abandoning the Crown, which, by Diſertion, he left vacant. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention aſſembled, ſeriouſly and ſincerely exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Matter, and declared it a true Vacancy according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reſolved to give themſelves a new Prince; upon which they offered me the Crown and Scepter, and conſtrained me to accept both; and, againſt my Will, forced me to ſuffer myſelf to be proclaimed King, in all the Forms and with all the Ceremonies accuſtomed. Obliged to yield to the Violence of their Choice, I rendred my Self depoſitary of a Crown which I am ready to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at any time the publick Tranquility will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
            <p>It's near five Years that I Reign on this Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>France</hi> alone perſiſts to diſturb me, and give me the odious Names of Uſurper and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: Names no way becoming a Prince of m<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Am I an Uſurper? Am I a Tyrant? Can any one of thoſe barbarous Qualities which form the one, or the other, be obſerved in my Conduct? Am I born a Subject of <hi>England?</hi> Am I got into it by Force or Violence? Have I overloaded its People with Levies and Taxes? Can I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with any of thoſe brutal Actions which darkens the Hiſtories of the moſt Illuſtrious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors? If I am neither an Uſurper nor a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but Rightful and Lawful King of <hi>England,</hi> what Shame can it be for <hi>France,</hi> at this time, to own me as ſuch? She, who at other times not only acknowledged ſuch, but concluded Treaties of Peace, Alliance and Commerce with 'em, as if they had been lawful Princes? But if this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of <hi>France</hi> cauſes all my Pain and Trouble, if by her ways ſhe alone hath hitherto oppoſed the Happineſs of my Fortune; I have ſtill this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſee my Self Recognized by all the other Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to ſee my Embaſſadors hold the ſame Rank at their Courts, which thoſe of <hi>England</hi> have always had. The Emperor, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>States General,</hi> have voluntarily entered into a League together to ſupport me upon the Throne: They'll ſooner periſh, as I may ſay, then let me fall; while my Enemies, by open Force, ſtrive to wreſt the Scepter from me. And when, on the contrary, they'll come to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and fair Means, I am of my ſelf ready to quit the Throne, in order to reſtore the Tranquility of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37173:3"/>
            <p> Let <hi>France</hi> gain as many Victories as ſhe will, let her take Towns and Ships, drown'd the Frontiers with Soldiers, threaten all the Earth with an enſuing Conqueſt; all that will but turn to her Ruin, becauſe ſhe is but one againſt many. Let her examin her own inward State; let her behold, with Motherly Eyes, the Dearth and Scarcity of Corn her Inhabitants are reduced to. In fine, let her ceaſe to delude, with the Power of her Mony, <hi>a Prince who freely renounces the Crown; and an Infant, who in a long time will not have Strength enough to wear it.</hi> Let her alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the number of Enemies ſhe is ſurrounded with; and let her meaſure the greatneſs of their Hatred to her, with that of her Outrages to them. Let her look upon all her concluded Treaties vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, all the Truces ſhe hath broke, all the Towns ſhe hath burnt, all the People ſhe hath reduced to Beggary, and who demand Juſtice of Heaven for theſe Evils. Let her at laſt ſeriouſly reflect on the unſteadineſs of her own Conduct, and ſhe'll find her ſelf guilty of the ſame Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhe unjuſtly upbraids me with, and whereof ſhe accuſes my Allies.</p>
            <p>Would a Treaty of Peace ſecure unto us her Friendſhip, tho', to obtain it, we ſhould grant her all her Pretenſions? Would the Emperor truſt to it, after ſeeing her, in cold Blood, break a Truce of 20 Years, newly concluded between her and him? Would the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſend his Fleet to Sea with Safety, after the Inſult made in full Peace upon his Admiral <hi>Papachini?</hi> Wou'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> be more Civilly treated by her Miniſter? Wou'd the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> keep their Countries and Privileges with Security and Freedom? And would not the <hi>States General</hi> have cauſe to fear her Reſentment and Revenge, in Hatred to the generous Protection, and the powerful Succours which they have given me?</p>
            <p>However, if it be reſolved to reſtore Peace to <hi>Europe</hi> who require it, all the World that ſeek it will be aſtoniſhed at the Effort which ſecretly invites me to it, when every one tells me that the publick Good ought to weigh over my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantage.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore commit that happy Violence upon our Selves, and ſacrifice my Glory to this Repoſe; and let us at leaſt by exceſs of Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſurpaſs thoſe, who have not been able to overcome us by their Arms.</p>
            <p>To accompliſh ſo fine a Project, and of ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral an Advantage, I declare. as to my part, I am ready to renounce the Three Crowns of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to abandon theſe <hi>Iſles</hi> for ever, and give 'em up to King <hi>James, ſecure the Poſſeſſion of them to the Prince his Son,</hi> and to return to <hi>Holland</hi> quietly to exerciſe the Dignity of <hi>Stateholder;</hi> if <hi>France</hi> will but on her part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her ſelf to the Execution of the <hi>Pyrenean.</hi> Treaty, and conſent to annul all ſubſequent Ones. His <hi>Most Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> knows that he never performed but One Article of that Treaty, which without any other Proof is ſufficiently evinced from all that's paſſed ſince that time.</p>
            <p>If Offers ſo reaſonable and Propoſals ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious be rejected, the evil Conſequences of their refuſal ought not to be imputed to me: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice I make to the publick Good is a ſufficient Juſtification of me, and is a Satisfaction to me in the midſt of my Pains and Afflictions. I quit a Radiant Crown and a Scepter Illuſtrious and Flouriſhing, to give them to another. I deſcend of my own Accord, without Violence and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conſtraint, from the Throne, after having had the extream Pleaſure of mounting it, and Sweet of commanding in it. I forſake Fortune, Honour, Glory and Triumph, to become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in re-aſſuming a private Condition. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as it were a Phantom, after having been ſomething on the Theater of the World, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having had ſo much Suceeſs, whereof I ought now to enjoy the Benefit; I reſerve no more on't to my Ambition and Fortune than the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Shadow.</p>
            <p>After this let my Enemies ſay what they will againſt me, let 'em form all the Ideas to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they pleaſe, my Sincerity will give the Lie to all their Impoſtures. They ſhall always find me ready to execute what I offer; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to reſtore, together with the Peace, the Tranquility and Happineſs which they have loſt.</p>
